# Aps-fault-Detection
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air. This project pivots to solve the binary classification problem, in which it is to be determined whether the fault in a given vehicle is due to APS or not, aiming to keep the false negatives as low as they could be.
